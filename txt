Recaps
started on the 5th of april,2018 due to school work overload.
it was challenging.
my coding style doesn't look perfect to me.
definitely i have to improve.
at least, i can cut myself some slack, i have designed and completed a very huge (as per a beginner) project.

problems encountered
i was using var, i was having lots of bugs in my javascript (my variables where undefined).... i consulted google and learnt of a new way....using let.
i still don't understand why, we find out tho... but i have to submit before the 11th, we check about it later....lol
